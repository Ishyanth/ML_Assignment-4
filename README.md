Fall 2022 5710 Machine Learning: Assignment 4   
Programming elements: Linear Regression, K-Means Clustering and Data Analysis  
1. Applying Linear Regression to the dataset  
a. Import the given “Salary_Data.csv”   
b. Split the data in train_test partitions, such that 1/3 of the data is reserved as test subset.  
c. Train and predict the model.  
d. Calculating the mean_squared error  
e. Visualizing both train and test data using scatter plot.  
  
2. Apply K means clustering in the dataset 
a. Removing any null values by the mean.  
b. Using the elbow method to find a good number of clusters with the K-Means algorithm  
c. Calculating the silhouette score for the above clustering  
  
3. Feature scaling and then applying K-Means on the scaled features.
